# üßæ Employee Material Management System

**Developed for:** Ethiopian Statistics Service (ESS)  
**Prepared by:** Demirewu Manidefro  
**Program:** Data Science Internship  
**Duration:** 2 Months  
**Institution:** Ethiopian Statistics Service (ESS)  
**Supervisor:** Stotaw (ESS Manager)  
**Date:** October 2025

## 1. Abstract

This project, titled **Employee Material Management System**, was developed during a two-month Data Science Internship at the **Ethiopian Statistics Service (ESS)**.

The main goal of the project is to **digitize and simplify the management of office materials**, including tracking of borrowed items, returned materials, and employees who have left or are waiting to return materials.

The system is implemented using **Flask (Python Framework)** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** for the database, and **HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)** for the frontend.  
The application provides secure **role-based access (Admin, Supervisor, and Viewer)**, data export functionality, and a **clean, responsive user interface**.  
The project was also deployed on **Render**, demonstrating the intern‚Äôs ability to work with online servers and cloud databases.

## 2. Introduction

The Ethiopian Statistics Service manages a wide range of resources and employees across departments. Traditional paper-based systems for recording the borrowing and returning of materials are **time-consuming**, **error-prone**, and **difficult to monitor**.

To address these issues, the Employee Material Management System was developed to provide a **digital, centralized, and automated** solution for material tracking and employee record management.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

The manual method of tracking materials in ESS led to several challenges:

- Difficulty in monitoring borrowed and returned items  
- Loss or duplication of material records  
- Inability to view available or borrowed materials instantly  
- Lack of accountability for employees who leave with unreturned items  

Hence, there was a clear need for a **web-based management system** to ensure **transparency, accountability, and efficiency**.

---

## 4. Objectives

### General Objective
To develop a **digital system** that automates and simplifies the management of materials and employee records at ESS.

### Specific Objectives
- To store and manage employee and material data efficiently using a relational database.  
- To enable borrowing and returning of materials with real-time updates.  
- To implement role-based access control for different system users.  
- To generate Excel reports and maintain a record of leave-out employees.  
- To deploy the system on a cloud platform (**Render**) for online access.

---

## 5. Scope of the Project

The system is designed for **internal use within ESS**. It covers:

- Adding and updating employee and material records  
- Borrowing and returning materials  
- Viewing available, borrowed, and returned materials  
- Tracking employees who have left or are waiting to return items  
- Role-based login and account management  
- Exporting data to Excel for reporting  

> This project focuses on **backend development**, **database design**, and **frontend integration**.  
> Mobile app support and advanced analytics are considered **outside the current scope**.

## 6. System Design & Architecture

The system follows the **three-tier architecture**:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
Built using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**, providing a clean, user-friendly dashboard.

### 2. Application Layer (Backend)
Developed using **Flask**, managing business logic, authentication, and routing.

### 3. Database Layer
Uses **PostgreSQL**, managed through **SQLAlchemy ORM**, to handle relationships between Employees, Materials, Borrowed Items, and Leave-Out Members.

**Entity Relationship Overview:**

## 7. Implementation Details

1. **Database Setup**  
   Configured PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM, defining models for:
   - Employee  
   - Material  
   - BorrowedMaterial  
   - LeaveOutMember  

2. **Backend Development**  
   - Implemented Flask routes for adding, borrowing, returning, and exporting data.  
   - Added session management and flash messages for user feedback.

3. **Frontend Design**  
   - Created HTML templates for all major operations.  
   - Integrated Bootstrap for responsiveness and consistent styling.

4. **Security & Authentication**  
   - Implemented login and registration with **password hashing**.  
   - Added **role-based access (Admin, Supervisor, Viewer)** for controlled permissions.

5. **Deployment**  
   - Deployed on **Render**, connecting to a cloud PostgreSQL database.  
   - Minor online connection issues identified and under review.
